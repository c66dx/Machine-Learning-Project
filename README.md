# Machine Learning - Project 
 The work focuses on the development of a predictive model to estimate the strength of concrete using machine learning techniques and neural networks. The objective is to create an accurate model that can predict the strength of concrete based on various characteristics such as concrete age, cement content, amount of water and other components.
